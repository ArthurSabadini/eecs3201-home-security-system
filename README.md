# Home Security System

This project was created for the EECS3201 Digital Systems Design course at York University, Toronto, Canada.

The project aimed to model and develop a home security system, using digital design principles with an FPGA (DE10-Lite), a distance sensor with a peculiar communication
protocol, and other actuators. The system allows the user to set a 4-bit password. When the password is entered correctly through the board's switches, the user is allowed to change the mode
of the system (i.e. armed, unarmed). Suppose the distance sensor measures any movements, and the password is not entered correctly within a certain time. In that case, we use buzzers and LEDs to simulate the system contacting security personnel.

The project was intended for educational and assessment purposes only. The final video demonstration can be found at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGY3ZGjNfwI.
