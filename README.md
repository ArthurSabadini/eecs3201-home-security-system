This project was created for the course EECS3201 Digital Systems Design at York University, Toronto, Canada.

The purpose of the project was to model and develop a home security system, using digital design principles with an FPGA (DE10-Lite), a distance sensor with a peculiar communication
protocol, and other actuators. The system allows the user to set a 4 bit password, when the password is entered correctly through the board's swicthes, the user is allowed to change the mode
of the system (i.e. armed, unarmed). If the distance sensor measures any movements, and the password is not entered correctly within a certain amount of time, we use buzzers and LEDs to simulate 
the system contacting security personel.

The project was intended for educational and assessment purposes only.
